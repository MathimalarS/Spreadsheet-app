Spreadsheet App (React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS)

This project is a **front-end spreadsheet interface**, built using **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**. 
It replicates a Google Sheets or Excel-like layout as per the [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/design/3nywpu5sz45RrCmwe68QZP/Intern-Design-Assigment?node-id=2-2535&t=DJGGMt8I4fiZjoIB-1) shared for the React Intern Assignment.

The goal is to demonstrate strong UI development skills, pixel-perfect design, interactive components, and clean code architecture.
